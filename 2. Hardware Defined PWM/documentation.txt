#Overview

This code drives an RGB LED using pins 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 with a PWM period of 1ms. The RGB LED cycles between six colors in the order: Red, Orange, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple. The amount of colors between the main six colors is adjustable for a smooth color transition.

#Features

- Drives RGB LED with pins 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2
- PWM period of 1ms
- Cycles between six colors: Red, Orange, Green, Cyan, Blue, and Purple
- Adjustable amount of colors between the main six colors for a smooth color transition

#Functions

- LEDSetup(): Initializes LED pins and enables interrupts
- TimerSetup(): Initializes the timer for PWM and interrupts
- Timer1_B0_ISR(): Interrupt service routine for handling LED transitions

#Usage

- Connect an RGB LED to pins 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2
- Run the code on the MSP430 microcontroller
- Observe the LED cycling between the six colors in order

#Note

- Avoid setting TB3CCR1, TB3CCR2, or TB3CCR3 to values greater than PERIOD, as this may cause unexpected behavior.
